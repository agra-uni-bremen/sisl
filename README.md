# SISL User Manual

This is source for the SISL user manual.

To generate a HTML file from the available markdown document, install
[discount](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/) and
execute the `./build.sh` script. This will generate an `index.html`
documentation which will then be served via GitHub pages.
